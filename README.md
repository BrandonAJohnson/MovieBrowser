# MovieBrowser
A movie browser using the tmdb api (https://www.themoviedb.org/) and React
The project currently uses base Bootstrap for styles.

## Warning
This API is not open and will require an api key from tmdb. A free version does exist which will require a submission to tmdb.

## Setup
A config.json file will need to be added to the src directory to pull the api key for this project.
This file is ignored so a local file will need to be added with this information.
Example config.json file:
```
{
  "apiKey" : "REPLACEWITHYOURAPIKEY"
}
```
